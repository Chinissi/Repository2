## Create & Edit Expectations

{% if batch_request %}
Add expectations by calling specific expectation methods on the `validator` object. They all begin with `.expect_` which makes autocompleting easy using tab.
{% else %}
You are adding Expectation configurations to the suite.  Since there is no sample batch of data, no validation happens during this process. See our documentation for more info and examples: **[How to create a new Expectation Suite without a sample batch](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/guides/how_to_guides/creating_and_editing_expectations/how_to_create_a_new_expectation_suite_without_a_sample_batch.html)**.
{% endif %}

You can see all the available expectations in the **[expectation glossary](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/reference/glossary_of_expectations.html?utm_source=notebook&utm_medium=create_expectations)**.
