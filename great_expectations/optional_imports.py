"""Utilities to handle optional imports and related warnings e.g. sqlalchemy.

Great Expectations contains support for datasources and data stores that are
not included in the core package by default. Support requires install of
additional packages. To ensure these code paths are not executed when supporting
libraries are not installed, we check for existence of the associated library.

We also consolidate logic for warning based on version number in this module.
