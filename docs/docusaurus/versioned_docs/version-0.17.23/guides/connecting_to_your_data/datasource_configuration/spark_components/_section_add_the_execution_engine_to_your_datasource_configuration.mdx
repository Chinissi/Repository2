<PartAddTheBackendExecutionEngineToYourDatasourceConfiguration backend="Spark" />

For the purposes of this guide, these will consist of the `SparkDFExecutionEngine` found at `great_expectations.execution_engine`.  The `execution_engine` key and its corresponding value will therefore look like this:

```python name="version-0.17.23 define spark execution engine"
```

After adding the above snippet to your Data Source configuration, your full configuration dictionary should now look like:

```python name="version-0.17.23 spark datasource_config up to definition of Spark execution engine"
```
