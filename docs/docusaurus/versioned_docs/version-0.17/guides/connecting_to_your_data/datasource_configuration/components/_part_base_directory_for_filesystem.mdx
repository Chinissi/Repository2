For the base directory, you will want to put the relative path of your data from the folder that contains your Data Context.  Since we are manually entering this value rather than letting the CLI generate it, the key/value pair will look like:

```python title="Python" name="version-0.17.23 inferred data connector add base_directory"
        "base_directory": "../data",
```
