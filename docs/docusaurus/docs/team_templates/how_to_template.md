<!-- Provide a meaningful overview here. Tell the user what they will accomplish and what value it provides. Use second person rather than first person â€” you instead of we. Address the reader as you, and assume that the reader is the person who's doing the tasks that you're documenting. What follows is an example provided for your reference. -->

You can use an auto-initializing Expectation to automate parameter estimation in your Expectations. Automating parameter estimation can lower execution time and improve the accuracy of your data validations.

To complete this how-to, you'll complete the following tasks:

- Verify if your Expectation is auto-initializing

- Run an Expectation with `auto=True`

- Save your expectation with calculated values

## Prerequisites

<!-- List the items that need to be present or completed by the user before they start the tasks. Link to relevant information if it's available. What follows is an example provided for your reference. If there aren't any prerequisites, remove this section.-->

- [A Great Expectations instance](/docs/guides/setup/setup_overview)
- [A Data Connection](/docs/guides/connecting_to_your_data/connect_to_data_overview)
- [An Expectation Suite](/docs/guides/expectations/create_expectations_overview) 

## First task 

<!-- Update the task heading. Use sentence case for headings and titles and avoid using -ing verb forms (gerunds) in headings or titles. Section headings should describe the type of content that's in the section. For example, Create an instance. For more information about the correct heading format, see [Headings and titles](https://developers.google.com/style/headings)-->

<!-- In a numbered list, describe what the user must do to accomplish the task successfully. Avoid long narrative descriptions of functionality and behaviour. If the behaviour is obvious, it doesn't need to be described. Provide users with only the information they need to know. When necessary, provide or link to code samples. What follows is an example provided for your reference. -->

## Second task

<!-- If necessary, add a secondary task here. Use the same format that you used in the first task. What follows is an example provided for your reference. -->

## Third task

<!-- If necessary, add a tertiary task here. Use the same format that you used in the first task. What follows is an example provided for your reference. -->

<!-- If necessary, continue adding tasks following the format you used in the first, second, and third tasks. -->
