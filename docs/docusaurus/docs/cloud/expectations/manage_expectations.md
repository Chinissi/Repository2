An Expectation is a verifiable assertion about your data. They make implicit assumptions about your data explicit, and they provide a flexible, declarative language for describing expected behavior. They can help you better understand your data and help you improve data quality.

To learn more about Expectations, see [Expectation](../../terms/expectation.md).

## Prerequisites

- You have [set up your environment](../set_up_gx_cloud.md). 

- You have a [Data Asset](/docs/cloud/data_assets/manage_data_assets#create-a-data-asset).

1. In GX Cloud, click **Data Assets**.

2. In the **Data Assets** list, click the Data Asset name.

3. Click **New Expectation**.

4. Select an Expectation type, enter the column name, and then complete the optional fields.

    If you prefer to work in a code editor, or you want to configure an Expectation from the [Expectations Gallery](https://greatexpectations.io/expectations/), click the **JSON Editor** tab and define your Expectation parameters in the code pane.

5. Click **Save**.

6. Optional. Repeat steps 1 to 4 to add additional Expectations.
