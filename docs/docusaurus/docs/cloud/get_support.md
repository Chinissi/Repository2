description: Learn what resources are available to help you resolve issues with GX Cloud.
---

The information provided here is intended to help you resolve GX Cloud issues. Several resources are available, including the collective knowledge of a very active community and experienced GX Developer Advocates (DAs). Knowing what resources are available and how to ask questions will simplify your support experience.

## Try solving your issue first

The following are some recommendations for resolving issues on your own. Resolving issues on your own builds your own knowledge and provides you with an opportunity to share that knowledge with the community. 

### Search the GX Cloud documentation

Search the docs you're using currently for an answer to your issue or question. If you're new to GX Cloud and are using Snowflake, try the [Quickstart for GX Cloud and Snowflake](quickstarts/snowflake_quickstart.md). If you're interested in reviewing features and functionality, see [Set up GX Cloud](/docs/cloud/set_up_gx_cloud).  

### Search with your favorite browser search engine

It's very likely that someone, somewhere has previously encountered or solved the issue you're currently experiencing. Perform a keyword search in your favorite browser search engine to discover resources outside GX Cloud documentation. 

## Ask the right questions and provide the right information

Taking the time to formulate your questions properly and providing all the relevant background information can save time and improve response times. The following are some recommendations that will help the DAs and other community members help you. 

### Include all the relevant information

Clearly explain the issue you're experiencing, or the problem you're trying to solve. When asking questions, you should provide the following:

- The complete error log or logs. 

- The version of GX Cloud you're using.

- A detailed explanation of what you're trying to resolve including what attempts you've made on your own to date.

### Don't post in multiple channels and use threads

Post GX Cloud questions or request help in the [GX Cloud Slack channel](https://greatexpectationstalk.slack.com/archives/C051D941XAL). Don't post in multiple channels. When responding to a post, use threads. If you need to post large code blocks, post them in a thread to avoid overwhelming the channel.

### Don't tag individual users

Even if you've previously developed a rapport with a specific GX DA, or a community member, don't tag them in new Slack posts. GX DA and community member availability varies. Also, the GX DAs operate on a rotation schedule to ensure equal time working with the open source community, and you never know who is available or who has the knowledge to solve your issue. Tagging specific users can limit the scope of the response. Also, the community is typically very responsive and helpful. If you don't get a response within a reasonable time, review your post and ensure you've framed your questions correctly and provided the necessary background information. If you don't get a response, or it's unhelpful, try an alternate medium to resolve your issue.

## Select the correct medium for questions and support

GX provides the following resources for questions and support:

- If you've encountered an error and are stuck, get support on the [GX Cloud Discourse forum](https://discourse.greatexpectations.io/c/cloud-support/17)

- If you want to chat with community members about general issues and solutions, join the [GX Cloud Slack channel](https://greatexpectationstalk.slack.com/archives/C051D941XAL)
