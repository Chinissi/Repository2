The GX Cloud workflow is a sequence of tasks you complete to perform data validations.

You connect GX Cloud to a Data Asset stored on your Data Source, you define and create an Expectation, and then you run a Validation on the data defined in the Expectation. Knowing that your data meets your Expectations helps you ensure your data is accurate and reliable and alerts you to issues before they become problematic.

The following table lists the sequence of tasks that you complete in a typical GX Cloud workflow. A brief description of the task and links to the relevant topics are provided.

| Task                                     | Description                                                        |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Create a Data Asset](/cloud/data_assets/manage_data_assets.md#create-a-data-asset) | The Data Asset contains the data you want to examine and validate, and the Data Source is where the Data Asset is located. | 
| [Invite users](/cloud/users/manage_users.md#invite-a-user)    | Invite users to your GX Cloud organization.                       |
| [Create an Expectation](/cloud/expectations/manage_expectations.md)    | Define verifiable assertions about your data.                       |  
| [Run Validations](/cloud/validations/manage_validations.md)                          | Run a Validation to determine if your data meets the assertions in the Expectation.                       |
