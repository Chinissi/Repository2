title: Contributing with GitHub

To edit documentation and avoid forking the repository, Great Expectations recommends using the GitHub markdown editor.

1. Open a browser and go to the [GitHub Great Expectations docs repository](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/tree/develop/docs).

2. Go to the file you want to edit. The topic URL contains the path to each topic. For example, the path for this topic is <https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/contributing/contributing_github> and it indicates the topic is located in the `contributing` folder and it's named `contributing_github`.

3. Click the file and then click **Edit this file**.

4. Add your edits. See the Great Expectations [Style Guide](./style_guides/docs_style.md) for formatting recommendations.

5. Optional. Click **Preview** to preview your changes.

6. When you’ve completed your edits, add a meaningful commit message and an explanation of what you changed and why in the **Propose changes** section.

7. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.

8. Click **Propose changes**.

    If this is your first contribution to Great Expectations documentation, you'll be prompted to complete the Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA). Complete the CLA and add `@cla-bot check` as a comment to the pull request (PR) to indicate that you’ve completed it.

9. Wait for the Continuous Integration (CI) checks to complete and correct any syntax or formatting issues.

    A Great Expectations team member reviews, approves, and merges your PR. Depending on your GitHub notification settings, you'll be notified when there are comments or when your changes are successfully merged.
