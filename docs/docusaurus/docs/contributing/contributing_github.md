title: Contributing with GitHub

To avoid forking the repository, Great Expectations recommends using the GitHub Markdown editor to edit documentation.

1. Open a browser and go to the [GitHub Great Expectations docs repository](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/tree/develop/docs).

2. Go to the topic file you want to edit. The topic URL contains the path to each topic file. For example, the path for this topic is <https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/contributing/contributing_github>. The URL indicates the topic is located in the `contributing` folder, and it's named `contributing_github`.

3. Click the file and then click **Edit this file**.

4. Add your edits. See the Great Expectations [Style Guide](./style_guides/docs_style.md) for formatting recommendations.

5. Optional. Click the **Preview** tab to preview your changes.

6. When you’ve completed your edits, scroll down to the **Propose changes** section and add a meaningful commit message and an explanation of what you changed and why.

7. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. Accept the default name for the branch, or enter a new one.

8. Click **Propose changes**.

    If this is your first Great Expectations documentation contribution, you'll be prompted to complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Complete the CLA and add `@cla-bot check` as a comment to the pull request (PR) to indicate that you’ve completed it.

9. Wait for the Continuous Integration (CI) checks to complete and then correct any syntax or formatting issues.

* Please pay close attention to the [Style Guide](./style_guides/docs_style.md).

### Submit a pull request

#### 3. Submit your edits as a PR

* When you’re done, add a meaningful commit message at the bottom. Use a short title and a meaningful explanation of what you changed and why.

* Click the `Propose File Change` button at the bottom of the page.

* Click the `Create Pull Request` button.

* Optionally: Add comment to explain your change, if it’s not already in the commit message.

* Click the next `Create Pull Request` button to create the actual PR.

#### 4. Sign the CLA

* If this is your first contribution to Great Expectations, You will see a comment from the “CLA Bot” that asks you to complete the Contributor Licence Agreement form.

* Please complete the form and comment on the PR to say that you’ve signed the form.

#### 5. Verify continuous integration checks

* Wait for the other Continuous Integration (CI) checks to go green and watch out for a comment from the automated linter that checks for syntax and formatting issues.

* Fix any issues that are flagged. (For documentation changes, it’s unlikely that you’ll have any issues.)

#### 6. Wait for a core team member to approve and merge your PR

* Once all checks pass, a Great Expectations team member will approve your PR and merge it.

* GitHub will notify you of comments or a successful merge according to your notification settings.

* If there are any issues, please address them promptly.

Congratulations! You’ve just contributed to Great Expectations!
