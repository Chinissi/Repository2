This guide will take you through the process of creating <TechnicalTag tag="expectation" text="Expectations" /> in Interactive Mode.  The term "Interactive Mode" denotes the fact that you are interacting with your data as you work.  In other words, you have access to a <TechnicalTag tag="datasource" text="Datasource" /> and can specify a <TechnicalTag tag="batch" text="Batch" /> of data to be used to create Expectations against.  Working in interactive mode will not edit your data: you are only using it to run your Expectations against.
