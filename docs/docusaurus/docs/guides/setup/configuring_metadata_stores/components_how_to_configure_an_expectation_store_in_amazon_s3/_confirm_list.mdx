If you followed the optional step to copy your existing Expectation Suites to the S3 bucket, you can confirm that Great Expectations can find them by running the following Python code:

```python
import great_expectations as gx

context = gx.get_context()
context.list_expectation_suite_names()
```

Your output should include the Expectations you copied to Amazon S3. If you did not copy Expectations to the new Store, they will not be listed.
