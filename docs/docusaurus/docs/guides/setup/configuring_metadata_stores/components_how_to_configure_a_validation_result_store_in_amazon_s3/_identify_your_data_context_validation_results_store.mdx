You can find your <TechnicalTag tag="validation_result_store" text="Validation Results Store" /> configuration within your <TechnicalTag tag="data_context" text="Data Context" />.

Look for the following section in your <TechnicalTag relative="../../../" tag="data_context" text="Data Context's" /> ``great_expectations.yml`` file:

```python name="tests/integration/docusaurus/deployment_patterns/aws_cloud_storage_pandas.py existing_validations_store"
```

This configuration tells Great Expectations to look for Validation Results in a Store called ``validations_store``. It also creates a ``ValidationsStore`` called ``validations_store`` that is backed by a Filesystem and will store Validation Results under the ``base_directory`` ``uncommitted/validations`` (the default).
