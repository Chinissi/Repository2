By default, <TechnicalTag tag="validation_result" text="Validation Results" /> are stored in JSON format in the ``uncommitted/validations/`` subdirectory of your ``great_expectations/`` folder.  Since Validation Results may include examples of data (which could be sensitive or regulated) they should not be committed to a source control system. The following steps will help you configure a new storage location for Validation Results in Amazon S3.
