You can install Great Expectations (GX) locally, or in hosted environments such as Databricks, Amazon EMR, or Google Cloud Composer. Installing GX locally lets you test features and functionality to determine if it's suitable for your use case. 

:::info Windows Support

Windows support for the open source Python version of GX is currently unavailable. If youâ€™re using GX in a Windows environment, you might experience errors or performance issues.
