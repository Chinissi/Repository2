In this guide we will demonstrate the process of requesting data from a Datasource that has been defined using the `context.sources.add_*` method.

If you are using a Datasource that was created by using the block-config method of directly building the Datasource's yaml or Python dictionary configuration, please see:
- [How to request data from a block-config style Datasource](/docs/guides/connecting_to_your_data/how_to_get_one_or_more_batches_of_data_from_a_configured_datasource)

## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites requirePython = {false} requireInstallation = {false} requireDataContext = {false} requireSourceData = {null} requireDatasource = {false} requireExpectationSuite = {false}>

- An installation of GX
- A Datasource with a configured Data Asset

</Prerequisites> 

## Steps

### 1. Import GX and instantiate a Data Context

```python title="Python code"
import great_expectations as gx

context = gx.get_context()
```

### 2. Retrieve your Data Asset

If you already have an instance of your Data Asset stored in a Python variable, you do not need to retrieve it again.  If you do not, you can instantiate a previously defined Datasource with your Data Context's `get_datasource(...)` method.  Likewise, a Datasource's `get_asset(...)` method will instantiate a previously defined Data Asset.

In this example we will use a previously defined Datasource named `my_datasource` and a previously defined Data Asset named `my_taxi_data_asset`.

```python title="Python code
my_asset = context.get_datasource("my_datasource").get_asset("my_taxi_data_asset")
```

### 3. (Optional) Build an `options` dictionary for your Batch Request

An `options` dictionary can be used to limit the Batches returned by a Batch Request.  Omitting the `options` dictionary will result in all available Batches being returned.

The structure of the `options` dictionary will depend on the type of Data Asset being used.  The valid keys for the `options` dictionary can be found by checking the Data Asset's `batch_request_options` property.

```python title="Python code"
print(my_asset.batch_request_options)
```

The `batch_request_options` property is a tuple that contains all the valid keys that can be used to limit the Batches returned in a Batch Request.

You can create a dictionary of keys pulled from the `batch_request_options` tuple and values that you want to use to specify the Batch or Batches your Batch Request should return, then pass this dictionary in as the `options` parameter when you build your Batch Request.

### 4. Build your Batch Request

We will use the `build_batch_request(...)` method of our Data Asset to generate a Batch Request.

```python title="Python code"
my_batch_request = my_asset.build_batch_request()
```

### 5. Verify that the correct Batches were returned

The `get_batch_list_from_batch_request(...)` method will return a list of the Batches a given Batch Request returns.  Because Batch definitions are quite verbose, it is easiest to determine what data the Batch Request will return by printing just the `batch_spec` of each Batch.

```python title="Python code"
batches = datasource.get_batch_list_from_batch_request(my_batch_request)
for batch in batches:
    print(batch.batch_spec)
```
