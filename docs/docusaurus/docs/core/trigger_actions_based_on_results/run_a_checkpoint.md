At runtime, a Checkpoint can take in dictionaries that filter the Batches in each Validation Definition and modify the parameters of the Expectations that will be validated against them. The parameters apply to every Validation Definition in the Checkpoint.  Therefore, the Validation Definitions grouped in a Checkpoint should have Batch Definitions that accept the same Batch filtering criteria. In addition, the Expectation Suites in each Validation Definition should also share a list of valid parameters.
