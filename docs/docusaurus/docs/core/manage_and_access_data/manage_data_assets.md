import InProgress from '../_core_components/_in_progress.md';

A Data Asset is a collection of records within a Data Source.  While a Data Source tells Great Expectations how to access data, a Data Asset represents the data itself.  Data Assets can optionally be further partitioned into Batches, which are subsets of the records within a Data Asset.  For instance, a Data Asset may contain all of the data spanning a year and be partitioned into Batches for each month.

For guidance on creating new Data Assets and organizing them into Batches see [Connect to data](/core/manage_and_access_data/connect_to_data/connect_to_data.md).
