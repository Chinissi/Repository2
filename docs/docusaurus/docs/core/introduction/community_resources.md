Great Expectations (GX) is committed to supporting and growing the GX community. It’s not enough to build a great tool. GX wants to build a great community as well.

Open source doesn’t always have the best reputation for being friendly and welcoming, and that makes us sad. Everyone belongs in open source, and GX is dedicated to making you feel welcome.
