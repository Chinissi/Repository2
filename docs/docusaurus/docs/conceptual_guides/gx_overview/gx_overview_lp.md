Great Expectations (GX) is a library for <PythonVersion />.  GX provides a framework for defining Expectations and running them against your data. 

This guide is intended for new users of Great Expectations (GX) and those looking for a more foundational understanding of GX, its components, and its principal workflows.  In Core Components you will be introduced to the moving parts of GX and how they interact without digging through the code itself.  Finally, Workflows will discuss the workflows for getting started with GX and for working with GX in an ongoing, iterative fashion.  This insight will help you understand the how and why of processes you work through in future tutorials.
