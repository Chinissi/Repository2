YData-Synthetic is an open-source synthetic data engine. Using different kinds of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS), the engine learns patterns and statistical properties of original data. It can create endless samples of synthetic data that resemble the original data.

The most recent guide for using Great Expectations (GX) with YData-Synthetic is for GX version 0.15.50 and can be read in [GX's versioned integration documentation for YData-Synthetic](/docs/0.15.50/deployment_patterns/how_to_use_great_expectations_with_ydata_synthetic).

to learn more about how to use YData-Synthetic to generate samples of synthetic data that reflect the original data they are patterned off of.
