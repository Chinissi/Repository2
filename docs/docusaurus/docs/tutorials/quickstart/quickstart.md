# Quickstart with Great Expectations

import Prerequisites from '/docs/components/_prerequisites.jsx'

## Introduction

Few things are as daunting as taking your first steps with a new piece of software.  This guide will introduce you to GX and demonstrate the ease with which you can implement the basic GX workflow. We will walk you through the entire process of installing GX, connecting to some sample data, building your first Expectation based off of an initial Batch of that data, validating your data with that Expectation, and finally reviewing the results of your validation.

Once you have completed this guide you will have a foundation in the basics of using GX.  In the future you will be able to adapt GX to suit your specific needs by customizing the execution of the individual steps you will learn here.

## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites requirePython = {true} requireInstallation = {false} requireDataContext = {false} requireSourceData = {null} requireDatasource = {false} requireExpectationSuite = {false}>

- The ability to install Python packages with pip
- A working internet browser
- A passion for data quality

</Prerequisites> 

## Overview

With GX you can get up and running with just a few lines of code.  The full process you'll be using will look like:

```bash title="Terminal input"
pip install great_expectations
```

```python title="Python code"
import great_expectations as gx

# Set up
context = gx.get_context()

# Connect to data
datasource = context.datasources.add_pandas_filesystem(base_folder="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/great_expectations/")
csv_asset = datasource.add_csv_asset(name="MyTaxiData", regex="taxi_data.csv")
batch_request_from_csv = csv_asset.build_batch_request()

# Create Expectations
validator = context.get_validator(batch_request=batch_request_from_csv)
validator.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("pickup_datetime")

# Validate data
result = validator.validate()
result.view()
```

That's not a lot of code, is it?  In the following steps we'll break down exactly what is happening here so that you can follow along and perform a Validation yourself.


## Steps

### 1. Install GX and set up your code environment

#### 1.1 Install GX using pip

Starting from an empty base directory inside a Python virtual environment, we use pip to install Great Expectations:

```bash title="Terminal input"
pip install great_expectations
```

When you run this command from the terminal you will see `pip` go through the process of installing GX and it's related dependencies.  This may take a moment to complete.

#### 1.2 Import Great Expectations

For the rest of this tutorial we will be working with Python code in a Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter is included with GX and provides a very convenient interface that lets us easily edit code and immediately see the result of our changes.

The code to import the `great_expectations` module is:

```python title="Python code"
import great_expectations as gx
```

#### 1.3 Instantiate a Data Context

We will get a `DataContext` object with the following code:

```python title="Python code"
context = gx.get_context()
```

The Data Context will provide you with access to a variety of utility and convenience methods.  It is the entry point for using the GX Python API.

### 2. Connect to data

For the purpose of this guide, we will connect to `.csv` data stored in our GitHub repo.  First, we will define a Datasource that uses our GitHub repo as it's `base_folder`:

```python title="Python code"
datasource = context.datasources.add_pandas_filesystem(base_folder="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/great_expectations/")
```

Next, we will specify the file that we want to connect to by creating a Data Asset in our Datasource:

```python title="Python code"
csv_asset = datasource.add_csv_asset(name="MyTaxiData", regex="taxi_data.csv")
```

Finally, we will tell Great Expectations to request the data that our `csv_asset` is connected to:

```python title="Python code"
batch_request_from_csv = csv_asset.build_batch_request()
```


### 3. Create Expectations

#### 3.1 Get a Validator object for our data

We will use a Validator to create Expectations about a provided set of data, and to validate the data against those Expectations.  The data that we will use in this example is the data that we requested from the `taxe_data.csv` file in our `batch_request`, previously.

We define our Validator with the code:

```python title="Python code"
validator = context.get_validator(batch_request=batch_request_from_csv)
```

#### 3.2 Define an Expectation

At this point, we will describe our Expectations for the data in question.  In this example, we will define a single Expectation based on our domain knowledge (that is: based on what we know _should_ be true about our data, without looking at the actual state of the data).

The code we will use for this is:

```python title="Python code"
validator.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("pickup_datetime")
```

With the Expectation defined above, we are stating that we _expect_ the column `pickup_datetime` to always be populated.  That is: none of the column's values should be null.

In the future, you may define numerous Expectations by using the `validator.expect_*` syntax.  When you Validate data with the `validator` object, all of you Expectations will be run against the `validator`'s associated Datasource.

### 4. Validate data

#### 4.1 Execute your defined Expectations

Now that we have defined our Expectations it is time for GX to introspect our data and see if it corresponds to them.  (We call this process Validation.)  The code to run this process is:

```python title="Python code"
result = validator.validate()
```

#### 4.1 Review your results

Once the `validator` object finishes executing the `validate()` command, you can view the results of your Validation through the code:

```python title="Python code"
result.view()
```

## Next Steps 

Now that you've seen how easy it is to implement the GX workflow, it is time to customize that workflow to suit your specific use cases.

To help with this we have prepared some more detailed installation and setting up guides tailored to specific environments and resources.  For more details on installation and setup of GX, please see:

- [How to install Great Expectations in a hosted environment](/docs/guides/setup/installation/hosted_environment.md)

If you wish to continue working with the GX installation used in this Quickstart guide, you will likely want to configure your Data Context to persist through future Python sessions.  For more details on how to do this, please see:

- How to initialize or instantiate a specific Filesystem Data Context with `get_context(...)`
