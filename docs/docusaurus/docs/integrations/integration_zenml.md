[ZenML](https://zenml.io/) is an extensible, open-source framework for creating production-ready portable machine learning (ML) pipelines.  Integrating Great Expectations (GX) with ZenML helps data scientists and ML engineers to make data profiling and validation an integral part of their
production ML toolset and workflows.

:::info 

The most recent guide for using GX with ZenML was authored for GX version 0.15.50 and can be read in [GX's versioned integration documentation for ZenML](/docs/0.15.50/integrations/integration_zenml).

Consult [the ZenML documentation](https://docs.zenml.io/mlops-stacks/data-validators/great-expectations)
for more information on how to use Great Expectations together with ZenML.
