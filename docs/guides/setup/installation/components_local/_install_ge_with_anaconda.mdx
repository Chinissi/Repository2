Once you have confirmed that Python 3 is installed locally, you will want to ensure that Anaconda is installed by running:

```console title="Terminal command"
conda --version
```

If no version number is printed, [you can download Anaconda here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

Once Anaconda is installed, you can create and activate a new virtual environment by running:

```console title="Terminal command"
conda create --name YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME
conda activate YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME
```

Replace "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME" with the name you wish you use for your environment.

Finally, you can install Great Expectations by running:

```console title="Terminal command"
conda install -c conda-forge great-expectations
```
