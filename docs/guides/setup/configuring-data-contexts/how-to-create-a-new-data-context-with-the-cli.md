title: How to configure a new Data Context with the CLI
---

We recommend that you create new Data Contexts by using the a ``greate_expectations init`` command in the directory where you want to deploy Great Expectations.

```bash
great_expectations init
```

Please see the [Getting Started](../../../tutorials/getting_started/initialize-a-data-context.md) section for a more detailed tutorial on Data Contexts and getting a new project up and running.
