How to define a custom Expectation type
_________________________________________________________________

This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own Modular Expectations in 6 simple steps! 

.. admonition:: Prerequisites: This how-to guide assumes you have already:

  - :ref:`Set up a working deployment of Great Expectations <tutorials__getting_started>`
  
Modular Expectations are new in version 0.13. They utilize a class structure that is significantly easier to build than
ever before and are explained below!


Steps:
_____

#. **Plan Metric Dependencies**

   In the new Modular Expectation design, Expectations rely on Metrics defined by separate MetricProvider Classes, which are then referenced within the Expectation and used for computation. For more on Metric Naming Conventions, look at :ref:`Metric Naming Conventions <core_concepts>`

   Once you’ve decided on an Expectation to implement, think of the different aggregations, mappings, or metadata you’ll need to validate your data within the Expectation - each of these will be a separate metric that must be implemented prior to validating your Expectation. 

   Fortunately, many Metrics have already been implemented for pre-existing Expectations, so it is possible you will find that the Metric you’d like to implement already exists within the GE framework and can be readily deployed.


#. **Implement your Metric**

   If your metric does not yet exist within the framework, you will need to implement it yourself within a new file - a task that is quick and simple within the new modular framework. 

   Below lies the full implementation of an aggregate metric class, with implementations for Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and Apache Spark dialects. (Other implementations can be found in the dictionary of metrics).


.. code-block:: python

   from great_expectations.execution_engine import (
      PandasExecutionEngine,
      SparkDFExecutionEngine,
   )
   from great_expectations.execution_engine.sqlalchemy_execution_engine import (
      SqlAlchemyExecutionEngine,
   )
   from great_expectations.expectations.metrics.column_aggregate_metric import (
      ColumnMetricProvider,
      column_aggregate_metric,
   )
   from great_expectations.expectations.metrics.column_aggregate_metric import sa as sa
   from great_expectations.expectations.metrics.import_manager import F

   class ColumnMean(ColumnMetricProvider):
      """MetricProvider Class for Aggregate Mean MetricProvider"""

      metric_name = "column.aggregate.mean"

      @column_aggregate_metric(engine=PandasExecutionEngine)
   def _pandas(cls, column, **kwargs):
       """Pandas Mean Implementation"""
       return column.mean()

   @column_aggregate_metric(engine=SqlAlchemyExecutionEngine)
   def _sqlalchemy(cls, column, **kwargs):
       """SqlAlchemy Mean Implementation"""
       return sa.func.avg(column)

   @column_aggregate_metric(engine=SparkDFExecutionEngine)
   def _spark(cls, column, **kwargs):
       """Spark Mean Implementation"""
       return F.mean(column)


3. **Define Parameters**

   We have already reached the point where we can start building our Expectation! 

   The structure of a Modular Expectation now exists within its own specialized class - indicating it will usually exist in a separate file from the Metric. This structure has 3 fundamental components: Expectation Parameters, Dependency Validation, and Expectation Validation. In this step, we will address setting up our parameters.

   The parameters of an Expectation consist of the following:
   
   - **Metric Dependencies** - A tuple consisting of the names of all metrics necessary to evaluate the Expectation.
   - **Success Keys** - A tuple consisting of values that must / could be provided by the user and defines how the Expectation evaluates success.
   - **Default Kwarg Values (Optional)**  -  Default values for success keys and the defined domain, among other values.
   
   An example of Expectation Parameters is shown below (notice that we are now in a new Expectation class and building our Expectation in a separate file from our Metric):


.. code-block:: python

   class ExpectColumnMaxToBeBetween(ColumnExpectation):
      # Setting necessary computation metric dependencies and defining kwargs, as well as assigning kwargs default values
      metric_dependencies = ("column.aggregate.max",)
      success_keys = ("min_value", "strict_min", "max_value", "strict_max")

      # Default values
      default_kwarg_values = {
          "row_condition": None,
          "condition_parser": None,
          "min_value": None,
          "max_value": None,
          "strict_min": None,
          "strict_max": None,
          "mostly": 1,
          "result_format": "BASIC",
          "include_config": True,
          "catch_exceptions": False,
      }
      

4. **Validate Configuration**

   We have almost reached the end of our journey in implementing an Expectation! Now, if we have requested certain parameters from the user, we would like to validate that the user has entered them correctly via a validate_configuration method. 

   In this method, the user provides a configuration and we check that certain conditions are satisfied by the configuration. For example, if the user has given us a minimum and maximum threshold, it is important to verify that our minimum threshold does not exceed our maximum threshold:


.. code-block:: python

   def validate_configuration(self, configuration: Optional[ExpectationConfiguration]):
      """
      Validates that a configuration has been set, and sets a configuration if it has yet to be set. Ensures that
      necessary configuration arguments have been provided for the validation of the expectation.

      Args:
          configuration (OPTIONAL[ExpectationConfiguration]): \
              An optional Expectation Configuration entry that will be used to configure the expectation
      Returns:
          True if the configuration has been validated successfully. Otherwise, raises an exception
      """
      min_val = None
      max_val = None

      # Setting up a configuration
      super().validate_configuration(configuration)
      if configuration is None:
          configuration = self.configuration

      # Ensuring basic configuration parameters are properly set
      try:
          assert (
              "column" in configuration.kwargs
          ), "'column' parameter is required for column map expectations"
      except AssertionError as e:
          raise InvalidExpectationConfigurationError(str(e))

    # Validating that Minimum and Maximum values are of the proper format and type
    if "min_value" in configuration.kwargs:
        min_val = configuration.kwargs["min_value"]

    if "max_value" in configuration.kwargs:
        max_val = configuration.kwargs["max_value"]

    try:
        # Ensuring Proper interval has been provided
        assert (
            min_val is not None or max_val is not None
        ), "min_value and max_value cannot both be none"
        assert min_val is None or isinstance(
            min_val, (float, int)
        ), "Provided min threshold must be a number"
        assert max_val is None or isinstance(
            max_val, (float, int)
        ), "Provided max threshold must be a number"


5. **Validate**

   In this step, we simply need to validate that the results of our metrics meet our Expectation.

   The validate method is implemented as _validate. This method takes a dictionary named Metrics, which contains all metrics requested by your metric dependencies, and performs a simple validation against your success keys (i.e. important thresholds) in order to return a dictionary indicating whether the Expectation has evaluated successfully or not:

.. code-block:: python

   def _validate(
      self,
      configuration: ExpectationConfiguration,
      metrics: Dict,
      runtime_configuration: dict = None,
      execution_engine: ExecutionEngine = None,
   ):
      """Validates the given data against the set minimum and maximum value thresholds for the column max"""
      column_max = metrics.get("column.aggregate.max")

      # Obtaining components needed for validation
      min_value = self.get_success_kwargs(configuration).get("min_value")
      strict_min = self.get_success_kwargs(configuration).get("strict_min")
      max_value = self.get_success_kwargs(configuration).get("max_value")
      strict_max = self.get_success_kwargs(configuration).get("strict_max")

      # Checking if mean lies between thresholds
      if min_value is not None:
          if strict_min:
              above_min = column_max > min_value
          else:
              above_min = column_max >= min_value
      else:
          above_min = True

      if max_value is not None:
          if strict_max:
              below_max = column_max < max_value
          else:
              below_max = column_max <= max_value
      else:
          below_max = True

      success = above_min and below_max

      return {"success": success, "result": {"observed_value": column_max}}

6. **Test**

   When developing an Expectation, there are several different points at which you should test what you have written:

   1. During development, you should import and run your Expectation, writing additional tests for get_evaluation parameters if it is complicated
   2. It is often helpful to generate examples showing the functionality of your Expectation, which helps verify the Expectation works as intended.
   3. If you plan on contributing your Expectation back to the library of main Expectations, you should build a JSON test for it in the ``tests/test_definitions/name_of_your_expectation`` directory.

We have now implemented our own Custom Expectations! For more information about Expectations and Metrics, please reference (Link to core concepts).
