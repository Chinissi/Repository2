If you see a typo/mistake/gap anywhere in the Great Expectation documentation, a quick PR would be much appreciated.

Style guide for documentation
-------------------------------------------

**Capitalization**

* Great Expectations is always spaced and capitalized. (Good: "Great Expectations"; bad: "great_expectations", "great expectations", "GE")
* Headers are capitalized like sentences. Good: "Installing within a project." Bad: "Installing Within a Project."
* Core concepts are upper camel case and linked on first reference.
* We refer to ourselves in the first person plural (Good: "we", "our"; Bad: "I"). This helps us avoid awkward passive sentences. Occassionally, we refer to ourselves as "the Great Expectations team" for clarity.

**Organization**

Within the table of contents,

* Introduction
* Getting started
* Community
* Core concepts
* Guides
* Changelog and roadmap
