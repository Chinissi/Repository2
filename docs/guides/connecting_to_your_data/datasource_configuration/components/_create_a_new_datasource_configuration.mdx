A new Datasource can be configured in Python as a dictionary with a specific set of keys.  We will build our Datasource configuration from scratch in this guide, although you can just as easily modify an existing one.

To start, create an empty dictionary.  You will be populating it with keys as you go forward.

At this point, the configuration for your Datasource is merely:

```python
datasource_config: dict = {}
```

However, from this humble beginning you will be able to build a full Datasource configuration.
