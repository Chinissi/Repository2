In an Inferred Asset Data Connector for SQL data, all the behaviour for how Data Assets are inferred, how they are split into Batches, and how those Batches are sampled for data are configured in the Data Connector dictionary.  To alter any of these behaviours from the default, you will simply set your desired behaviour by defining one of the following optional key/value pairs.

#### Optional Data Connector configuration keys for inferring Data Assets

A Data Asset in an Inferred Asset Data Connector for SQL data will consist of a single table in the database you have connected to.  You can modify the way that the Data Connector infers which tables to utilize as Data Assets by defining the following key/value pairs in your Data Connector's dictionary in the Datasource configuration:

<NoteOptionalDataConnectorKeys inferred={true} />

#### Optional Data Connector configuration keys for splitting Data Assets into Batches

Next is the matter of how (or even if) your Data Connector splits Data Assets into Batches.  By default, each Data Asset will provide a single Batch consisting of the entire table that it corresponds to.  You can change this behaviour by specifying the following key/value pairs:

<NoteOptionalDataConnectorKeys splitting={true} />

:::note Reminder

If you are uncertain whether you should be splitting your Data Assets into Batches, please refer to our guide on [how to choose between working with a single or multiple Batches of data](../../how_to_choose_between_working_with_a_single_or_multiple_batches_of_data.md).

#### Optional Data Connector configuration keys for sampling data from returned Batches

Finally, you may wish to only sample a portion of the data that would be returned in your Data Asset's Batches.  To do this, you will need to define the optional keys `sampling_method` and `sampling_kwargs`.  As with `splitter_method` and `splitter_kwargs`, defining these key/value pairs in your Data Connector's dictionary will result in those values being applied to all Data Assets that are made available by the Data Connector.

The key/value pairs that are used for sampling data from a Data Asset are:

<NoteOptionalDataConnectorKeys sampling={true} />

:::tip

Although this guide will not use sampling in its examples, there is a list of the available sampling methods in [the Sampling methods subsection of the Additional notes section](#sampling-methods) at the end of this guide.
