Getting started
###############

Welcome to Great Expectations! This tutorial will help you set up your first deployment of Great Expectactions. We'll also introduce important concepts, with links to detailed material you can dig into later.

Please follow these steps to get started:

      <h2><span class="fa-stack">
         <span class="fa fa-circle-o fa-stack-2x"></span>
         <strong class="fa-stack-1x">

         </strong>
      </span> Initialize a DataContext</h2>
   </embed>

.. container:: custom-indented-paragraph

   In Great Expectations, your ``DataContext`` manages boilerplate configuration. Using a DataContext is almost always the fastest way to get up and running, even though some teams don't need every component of a DataContext.
   
   Follow these instructions to :ref:`getting_started__initialize_a_data_context`.

   Alternatively, if you really want to learn the components of Great Expectations from the ground up without a DataContext, check out `A magic-free introduction to Great Expectations.`_

      <h2><span class="fa-stack">
         <span class="fa fa-circle-o fa-stack-2x"></span>
         <strong class="fa-stack-1x">
            2
         </strong>
      </span> Connect to data</h2>
   </embed>

.. container:: custom-indented-paragraph

   Once you have a DataContext, you'll want to connect to data. Your data could live in files on disk, in a database, in a cloud store, etc. You might also manage connections to data through another orchestration tool.
   
   Great Expectations' ``DataSource`` and ``Generator`` classes handle all of these cases. They manage configuration and provide a consistent, cross-platform API for referencing data. Together, DataSources and Generators will allow you to reference meaningful batches of data for validation (and other use cases.)
   
   Check out `connect to data`_ to learn how to configure DataSources and Generators.

      <h2><span class="fa-stack">
         <span class="fa fa-circle-o fa-stack-2x"></span>
         <strong class="fa-stack-1x">
            3
         </strong>
      </span> Set up data documentation</h2>
   </embed>

.. container:: custom-indented-paragraph

   One of Great Expectations' core promises is that your tests and documentation will always stay in sync, because docs and tests are both `compiled from the same Expectations`_.
   
   To see how this works, follow the instructions ``here`` to set up a local static website for your data documentation. Later, you'll be able to `host the site remotely`_, or integrate content generated by Great Expectations into an external metadata store like `Google Data Catalog`_, `Amundsen`_, or `dbt docs`_.

Comment to let everyone know you’re working on it. 

   #FIXME: If there’s no issue for what you want to work on, please create one. Add a comment to let everyone know that you're working on it. We prefer small, incremental commits, because it makes the thought process behind changes easier to review.
