A Datasource provides a standard API for accessing and interacting with data from a wide variety of source systems.



NOTES: TEMPORARY
-----------------
Provides a unified API for using a Data Connector and an Execution Engine to access data, regardless of the native methods required to access the data associated with the Data Connector.
Brings together a way of interacting with data (an Execution Engine) and a way of accessing that data (a Data Connector). Data Assets live within a Datasource; Datasources are used to obtain Batches for Validators, Expectation Suites, and Profilers.
