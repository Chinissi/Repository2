How do I get started?
---------------------

It's easy! Just use pip install:

::

    $ pip install great_expectations


You can also clone the repository, which includes examples of using
great\_expectations.

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations.git
    $ pip install great_expectations/


Then go to the root directory of the project you want to use Great Expectations in and run:
::

    great_expectations init
