Great Expectations doesn't do X. Is it right for my use case?
-------------------------------------------------------------

It depends. If you have needs that the library doesn't meet yet, please
`upvote an existing
issue(s) <https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/issues>`__
or `open a new
issue <https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/issues/new>`__
and we'll see what we can do. Great Expectations is under active
development, so your use case might be supported soon.
