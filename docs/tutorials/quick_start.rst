.. admonition:: Admonition from Mr. Dickens.

    "What is before you is a fight with the world; and the sooner you begin it, the better."

Off we go! Install Great Expectations:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install great_expectations

From the root of the directory where you want to deploy Great Expectations:

.. code-block:: bash

    great_expectations init

The CLI will guide you through all the steps to set up a basic deployment of Great Expectations.

After that, if you want to understand what just happened, check out :ref:`Getting started`. Alternatively, you can :ref:`Customize your deployment <getting_started__customize_your_deployment>`.
