Customize your deployment
=========================

At this point, you have your first, working deployment of Great Expectations. You've also been introduced to the foundational concepts in the library: :ref:`Data Contexts`, :ref:`Datasources`, :ref:`Expectations`, :ref:`Profilers`, :ref:`Auto Docs`, :ref:`Validation`, and :ref:`Checkpoints`.

Congratulations! You're off to a very good start.

The next step is to customize your deployment by upgrading specific components of your deployment. :ref:`Data Contexts` make this modular, so that you can add or swap out one component at a time. Most of these changes are quick, incremental steps---so you can upgrade from a basic demo deployment to a full production deployment at your own pace and be confident that your Data Context will continue to work at every step along the way.

This last section of the :ref:`getting_started` tutorial is designed to present you with clear options for upgrading your deployment. For specific implementation steps, please check out the linked :ref:`how_to_guides`.

Options for storing Expectations
--------------------------------

Many teams find it convenient to store Expectations in git. Essentially, this approach treats Expectations like test fixtures: they live adjacent to code and are stored within version control. git acts as a collaboration tool and source of record.

Alternatively, you can treat Expectations like configs, and store them in a blob store. Finally, you can store them in a database.

Options for storing Validation Results
--------------------------------------
By default, Validation Results are stored locally, in an uncommitted directory. This is great for individual work, but not good for collaboration. The most common pattern is to use a cloud-based blob store such as S3, GCS, or Azure blob store. You can also store Validation Results in a database.

Additional DataSources and Generators
-------------------------------------

Great Expectations plugs into a wide variety of Datasources, and the list is constantly getting longer. If you have an idea for a Datasource not listed here, please speak up at [Some location].

Options for hosting Auto Docs
-----------------------------

By default, Auto Docs are stored locally, in an uncommitted directory. This is great for individual work, but not good for collaboration. A better pattern is usually to deploy to a cloud-based blob store (S3, GCS, or Azure blob store), configured to share a static website.

Triggering validation
---------------------

As we saw in the previous step of the tutorial, the basic Great Expectations deployment allows you to trigger validation from a notebook. This is great for getting started, but not usually the approach you
