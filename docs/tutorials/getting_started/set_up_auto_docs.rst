Set up Auto Docs
================

:ref:`Auto Docs<data_docs>` translate :ref:`Expectations`, :ref:`Validation Results`, and other metadata into clean, human-readable documentation. Automatically compiling your data documentation from your data tests guarantees that your documentation will never go stale---a huge workflow change from the sprawling, chronically-out-of-date data wikis that many data teams otherwise have to maintain.

When you open the window, you'll see a static website that looks like this:

<<<SCREENSHOT GOES HERE>>>

What just happened?
-------------------

In the previous step, our data Profiler generated a set of new Expectations. We just used Auto Docs to compile those Expectations to HTML, which you can see here. This page is *prescriptive*: it describes how data *should* look:

As mentioned in the previous step, our Profiler also generated Validation Results, which you can see here. This page is *descriptive*: it describes how a specific batch of data (in this case, the data we Profiled) actually looked when validated.

Finally, your static site includes a set of pages for future data validations. These pages are *diagnostic*: they describe whether and how a specific batch of data differed from the ideal prescribed by a set of Expectations.

The Auto Docs build chain
-------------------------

There's :ref:`quite a bit going on under the hood`_ here, but for the moment the details don't matter. You can think of Auto Docs as an elaborate makefile. Its inputs are Expectations, Validation Results, and other metadata. Its output is a static website.

<<<DIAGRAM>>>

Possibilities to keep in mind for the future:

* **The same metadata can be rendered more than once.** For example, you might want to use the same Expectation in a bullet point, and as an entry within a data dictionary on a different page.
* **You can build more than one target.** For example, if you share data outside your company, you might want one site to support internal engineering and analytics, and another site to support downstream clients consuming the data.
* **The build target for rendering does not need to be HTML.** For example: Slack messages and email notifications.
* **All components of the build chain are pluggable and extensible.** Like everything else in Great Expectations, you can extend Renderers.

<<<DIAGRAM>>>

This ability to translate between machine- and human-readable formats makes Great Expectations a powerful tool---not just for data testing, but also data communication and collaboration.

In the next step, we will complete set up by showing you how to Validate data, review the results, and edit your Expectations. Incidentally, this step will use another kind of renderer: a disposable notebook generated specifically to support this workflow.

.. attention:: Great Expectations Renderers are still an experimental feature. They're very useful, but expect changes in API, behavior, and XXX.
