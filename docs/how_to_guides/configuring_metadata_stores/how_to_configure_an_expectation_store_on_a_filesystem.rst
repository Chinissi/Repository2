How to configure an Expectation store on a filesystem
=====================================================


By default, newly profiled Expectations are stored in JSON format in the ``expectations/`` subdirectory of your ``great_expectations`` folder.  This guide will help you configure a new storage location for Expectations on your filesystem.

.. admonition:: Prerequisites: This how-to guide assumes that you have already:

    - Configured a :ref:`Data Context <tutorials__getting_started__initialize_a_data_context>`.
    - Configured an :ref:`Expectation Suite <tutorials__getting_started__create_your_first_expectations>`.
    - Determined a new storage location where you would like to store Expectations. This can either be a local path, or a path to a network filesystem.

Steps
-----

1. First create a new folder where you would to store your Expectations, and move your existing Expectation files over to the new location. In our case, the name of the Expectations file is ``npi_expectations`` and the path to our new storage location is ``/shared_expectations``.

.. code-block:: bash

    # in the great_expectations folder
    mkdir shared_expectations
    mv expectations/npi_expectations.json shared_expectations/


2. Next open the ``great_expectations.yml`` file and look for the following lines.

.. code-block:: yaml

    expectations_store_name: expectations_store

    stores:
        expectations_store:
            class_name: ExpectationsStore
            store_backend:
                class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
                base_directory: expectations/


The configuration file tells Great Expectations to look for Expectations in a Store called ``expectations_store``. The ``base_directory`` for ``expectations_store`` is set to ``expectations/`` by default.

3. Update your configuration following the example below. This example would change the Store name to ``shared_expectations_filesystem_store`` with the ``base_directory`` set to ``shared_expectations/``.

    Paths are relative to the directory where ``great_expectations.yml`` is stored.


.. code-block:: yaml

    expectations_store_name: shared_expectations_filesystem_store

    stores:
        shared_expectations_filesystem_store:
            class_name: ExpectationsStore
            store_backend:
                class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
                base_directory: shared_expectations/



4. Confirm that the location has been updated by running ``great_expectations store list``.

.. code-block:: bash

    great_expectations store list

    3 Stores found:

    - name: shared_expectations_filesystem_store
    class_name: ExpectationsStore
    store_backend:
        class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
        base_directory: shared_expectations/


5. Confirm that Expectations can be read from the new storage location by running ``great_expectations suite list``.

.. code-block:: bash

    great_expectations suite list

    1 Expectation Suite found:
        - npi_expectations


Additional Notes
----------------

- For best practices, we highly recommend that you store Expectations in a version-control system like Git. The JSON format of Expectations will allow for informative diff-statements and effective tracking of modifications. In the example below, 2 changes have been made to ``npi_expectations``.  The Expectation ```expect_table_column_count_to_equal`` was been changed from ``330`` to ``333`` to ``331``.


.. code-block:: bash

  git log -p npi_expectations.json
