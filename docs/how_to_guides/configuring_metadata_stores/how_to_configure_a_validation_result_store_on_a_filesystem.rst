How to configure a Validation Result store on a filesystem
=====================================================

By default, Validation results are stored in the ``great_expectations/uncommitted/validations/`` directory.  Since Validations may include examples of data (which could be sensitive or regulated) they should notÂ be committed to a source control system.

This guide will help you configure a new storage location for Validations on your filesystem.

.. admonition:: Prerequisites: This how-to guide assumes that you have already:

    - Configured a :ref:`Data Context <tutorials__getting_started__initialize_a_data_context>`.
    - Configured an :ref:`Expectation Suite <tutorials__getting_started__create_your_first_expectations>`.
    - Configured a :ref:`Checkpoint <tutorials__getting_started__set_up_your_first_checkpoint>`.
    - Determined a new storage location where you would like to store Validations. This can either be a local path, or a path to a secure network filesystem.

Steps
-----

1. Open the ``great_expectations.yml`` file and look for the following lines.

.. code-block:: yaml

    validations_store_name: validations_store

    stores:
        validations_store:
            class_name: ValidationsStore
            store_backend:
                class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
                base_directory: uncommitted/validations/


The configuration file tells Great Expectations to look for Validations in a store called ``validations_store``. The ``base_directory`` is set to ``uncommitted/validations`` by default.

2. Update your configuration file using the example below. In our case, Validations store is being set to ``shared_validations_filesystem_store``, but it can be any name you like.  Also, the ``base_directory`` is being set to ``uncommitted/shared_validations/``, but it can be set to any path accessible by Great Expectations.  Copy existing Validation results to the new folder if necessary.

.. code-block:: yaml

    expectations_store_name: shared_validations_filesystem_store

    stores:
        shared_validations_filesystem_store:
            class_name: ValidationsStore
            store_backend:
                class_name: TupleFilesystemStoreBackend
                base_directory: uncommitted/shared_validations/

3. Confirm that the Validation store has been updated by re-running a Checkpoint: ``great_expectations checkpoint run check_1``. You can also visualize the results by re-building :ref:`Data Docs <tutorials__getting_started__set_up_data_docs>`.

.. code-block:: bash

    great_expectations checkpoint run check_1  # check_1 is the name of our Checkpoint

    Validation Succeeded!
