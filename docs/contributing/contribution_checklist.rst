Contribution checklist
=======================

Once your code is ready and you want to submit a pull request, please go through the following checklist before submitting the PR to make sure the code review and merge process go smoothly:

1. You’ve signed the :ref:`community_cla` (CLA). If you’ve included your (physical) mailing address in the CLA, we’ll send you a personalized Great Expectations mug once your first PR is merged!
2. You’ve followed our :ref:`community_style_guide` for code and comments.
3. You’ve followed our guidelines on :ref:`contributing_testing`, meaning you have run all existing tests locally and you have added new tests where appropriate.
4. You have added a bullet with your changes under the **“develop”** heading in the :ref:`changelog`.

If you’ve checked off all these items, you’re now ready to submit a pull request! Check out the next section :ref:`contributing_submitting_your_contribution` for step-by-step instructions.
