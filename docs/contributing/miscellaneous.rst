*When you contribute code, you affirm that the contribution is your original work and that you license the work to the project under the project’s open source license. Whether or not you state this explicitly, by submitting any copyrighted material via pull request, email, or other means you agree to license the material under the project’s open source license and warrant that you have the legal authority to do so.*

Please make sure you have signed our Contributor License Agreement (either [Individual Contributor License Agreement v1.0](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdA-aWKQ15yBzp8wKcFPpuxIyGwohGU1Hx-6Pa4hfaEbbb3fg/viewform?usp=sf_link) or [Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") v1.0](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3RZ_ZRWOdymT8OnTxRh5FeIadfANLWUrhaSHadg_E20zBAQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)). We are not asking you to assign copyright to us, but to give us the right to distribute your code without restriction. We ask this of all contributors in order to assure our users of the origin and continuing existence of the code. You only need to sign the CLA once.
