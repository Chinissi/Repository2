Making changes directly through Github
==========================================

We suggest simply editing the docs using the GitHub markdown editor, which means you don’t have to fork the repo at all. Here’s how you do this:

* Go to the [Great Expectations (GE) docs](http://docs.greatexpectations.io/en/latest/).
* On each page, you’ll see an "Edit on GitHub" button in the top right - click this to go to the source file in the GE GitHub repo.
    * Or if you’re already on GitHub, the docs are located in great_expecations > docs. You can directly navigate to the respective page you want to edit (but getting there from the docs is a little easier).
* In the top right of the grey header bar of the actual file, click the pencil icon to get into edit mode on GitHub.
* Make your edits and use the Preview tab to preview changes.
* When you’re done, add a meaningful commit message at the bottom. Use a short title and a meaningful explanation of what you changed and why.
* Click the "Propose File Change" button at the bottom of the page.
* Click the "Create Pull Request" button.
    * Optionally: Add comment to explain your change, if it’s not already in the commit message.
* Click the next "Create Pull Request" button to create the actual PR.


--> Contribution checklist


* You will see a comment from the "CLA Bot" that asks you to complete the Contributor Licence Agreement form.
    * Please complete the form and comment on the PR to say that you’ve signed the form.
* Wait for the other Continuous Integration (CI) checks to go green and watch out for a comment from the automated linter that checks for syntax and formatting issues.
    * Fix any issues that are flagged.
* Once all checks pass, a GE team member will approve your PR and merge it. 
    * GitHub will notify you of comments or a successful merge according to your notification settings.
    * If there are any issues, please address them promptly.
* Congratulations! You’ve just contributed to Great Expectations!
