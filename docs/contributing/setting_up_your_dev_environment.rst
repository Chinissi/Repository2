Setting up your dev environment
==========================================


Prerequisites
-------------------

In order to contribute to Great Expectations, you will need the following:

* A GitHub account - this is sufficient if you only want to contribute to the documentation.
* If you want to contribute code, you will also need a working version of Git on your computer. Please refer to the [Git setup instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for your environment.
* We also recommend going through the [SSH key setup process on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for easier authentication.

???
----------------

Note that you will have the option to enable different backends for local testing, such as postgresql and Spark.
