#
# The pipeline is run under the following conditions:
#   - On the main branch when a weekly release is being cut
#   - On the develop branch as scheduled by the below cron job
#
#  `packaging` is meant to test the installation and packaging of Great Expectations in a variety of environments.

# trigger:
#   branches:
#     include:
