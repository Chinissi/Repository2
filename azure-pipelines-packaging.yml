# This file is responsible for configuring the `packaging` pipeline (https://dev.azure.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/_build)
#
# The pipeline is run under the following conditions:
#   - On the main branch when a weekly release is being cut
#   - On the develop branch as scheduled by the below cron job
#
#  `packaging` is meant to test the installation and packaging of Great Expectations in a variety of environments.

schedules:
- cron: 0 0 * * *
  displayName: Scheduled Runs
  branches:
    include:
    - develop
    exclude:
    - main
  always: true # As this is run once a day, we always want to run it (regardless of whether or not changes have occurred)

# trigger:
#   branches:
#     include:
#     - pre_pr-*
#     - main
#     exclude:

# The pipeline is run under two primary conditions: if merging into main or as scheduled by the above cron job.
