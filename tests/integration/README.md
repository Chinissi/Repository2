# Integration Tests

The purpose of this directory is two-fold:

1. Ideally, all non-unit tests will live here. Such as tests that require services. This allows for better developer experience and also has CI benefits.
2. This directory also contains code surfaced to users in documentation. This ensures code snippets in docs are robust and under test.
